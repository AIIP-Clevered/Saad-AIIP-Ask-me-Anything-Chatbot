# Saad-AIIP-Ask-me-Anything-Chatbot

#Project Description: 

Foxie The Chatbot; Foxie the chatbot is a chatbot that I, Saad Julqarnain, have created for the Clevered Internship Program. This is a chatbot that interacts with itâ€™s user and tries to be more like a person than a robot.  the chatbot has its classic mode, which is an Irish Foxie, its American Foxie, its British Foxie and finally a Spanish Foxie which speaks and listens to Spanish! 
 
My plans for Foxie are to add a Russian or Hindi talking and receipting Foxie which will most probably also have visual games along with oral games.
